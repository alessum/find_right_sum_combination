# Task 1:  
## Find the combination of numbers that summed gives a particular one
The job is divided into 2 python notebooks:
<ol>
  <li> <code>main.ipynb</code> is the main and it is where the algorithm is explained </li>
  <li> <code>tools.ipynb</code> is where the functions are created</li>
</ol>

  
I tried to find the simplest and most shallow circuit.

Hope everything is clear enough
