# Task 1:  
## Find the combination of numbers that summed gives a particular one
The job is divided into 2 python notebooks:
<code>main.ipynb</code> is the main and it is where the algorithm is explained
<code>tools.ipynb</code> is where the functions are created

I tried to find the simplest and shallow circuit and it seems it works fine.
Hope everything is clear enough ;)
